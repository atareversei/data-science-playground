# Feature Engineering and Visualizations

This module focuses on the **art of transforming and understanding data through visualization and feature engineering**.  
I explored how thoughtful feature selection and visual exploration can uncover patterns, correlations, and structures hidden in raw data.

## Overview

In this module, I continued working with **Pandas** for data manipulation and used **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn**, and **Plotly** extensively for visual exploration.  
I also integrated **yfinance** for retrieving real-world financial datasets.

By working with datasets like **Adult**, **Iris**, **World Population**, and **Financial (Stock)** data, I learned how to identify, select, and visualize features that most influence model performance and data interpretation.

## Topics Mentioned

### 1. Feature Engineering Concepts

- Understanding **feature selection** and its impact on modeling  
- Deciding **when and why** to create new features  
- Working with **numerical** and **categorical** variables  
- Exploring **correlation**

### 2. Data Visualization Techniques

- **Line charts** and **bar charts** for trends and comparisons  
- **Histograms** and **box plots** for distribution analysis  
- **Scatter plots** and **3D scatter plots** for relationships  
- **Bubble charts**, **treemaps**, and **pie charts** for categorical and hierarchical data visualization  
- Using color, scale, and layout effectively to communicate insights

### 3. Practical Applications

- Visualizing real-world demographic and income data  
- Exploring relationships between population and economic features  
- Analyzing market trends with stock data from `yfinance` (incomplete)
- Identifying patterns in feature relationships before modeling

## Datasets Used

| Dataset               | Description                                         | Source   |
|-----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|----------|
| **Adult Income**      | Demographic dataset for income classification       | UCI      |
| **Iris**              | Classic dataset for pattern recognition and EDA     | Unknown  |
| **World Population**  | Global demographic and growth data                  | Kaggle   |
| **Financial Data**    | Stock prices and financial trends                   | yfinance |

## Tools and Libraries

- **Python**
- **Pandas** for data handling
- **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn**, and **Plotly** for visualization
- **yfinance** for fetching live market data

## Skills Gained

- Selecting and engineering features for better model interpretability  
- Creating diverse, informative visualizations with Seaborn and Matplotlib  
- Understanding correlations and feature relationships visually  
- Gaining intuition on how features influence model outcomes
